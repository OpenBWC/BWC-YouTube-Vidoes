Cop Fatally Shoots 13-year-old Boy Armed With Pellet Gun', 'description': ""* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *\nUtica, N.Y. ‚Äî On June 28, 2024, at approximately 10:18 p.m. Utica Police officers were proactively patrolling the West Utica area near Shaw Street to assist the Criminal Investigations Division (‚ÄúCID‚Äù) with at least two recent robbery investigations in which the suspects brandished a black in color firearm and forcibly demanded and stole property from victims. In one of the incidents that occurred on June 27th, the suspects were described as one one being on foot and the other on a bicycle. Based on the identifying factors from the robbery, officers approached 13-year-old Nyah Mway and the other juvenile as they matched the robbery suspects‚Äô descriptions and were in the immediate vicinity of the previous robbery at nearly the same time of day. Furthermore, he was walking in the roadway in violation of New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law 1156a. At the time of the stop, the officers were following requests from the Criminal Investigations Division to interview and identify parties matching the characteristics of the robbery suspects, which, as stated, the two juveniles matched. \n\nAccordingly, the officers attempted to conduct a citizen stop of the two 13-year-old juveniles. When the officers asked and went to pat frisk Nyah Mway, he immediately fled on foot. While fleeing he turns and appears to point a black item at Officer Bryce Patterson and the other officers. Officer Patterson caught up with Nyah Mway, tackled and punched him, and as the two wrestled on the ground, Officer Patrick Husnay opened fire. The single shot hit Nyah Mway in the chest. Nyah Mway was taken to Wynn Hospital, where he died of his injuries. The item Nyah Mway was holding was later determined to be a BB or pellet gun that closely resembled a Glock 17 Gen 5 handgun with a detachable magazine. Police released an image showing the device did not have an orange band on the barrel that many BB gunmakers have added in recent years to distinguish their products from firearms.\n\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\nSpecial thanks to Shout-Out Supporters on Patreon:\n- 'DIY Solar Power with Will Prowse'\n- Zak Bennett\n- Jeff Short\n- 'walleye truth2power'\n- Spencer Scott\n- RayJayOB\n- Sean Sheldon\n- Marvin Tobar\n- Lee Roberts\n- 'Mr. Unknown'\n- 'iqtester.org'\n- Josef Rex\n- 'Skydog'\n- Jesse\n- √Åd√°m Lamp√©rt\n- Sabrina Bewey\n- Kelly Goodwin\n- 'wuzy'\n- 'Jun'\n- 'Xenik'\n- 'Rom'\n- kyle McBurnett\n- 'Fishy Tuna'\n- 'GotsNoGroove Cheryl'\n- 'CombatKid'\n- Exus Altimus\n- 'Dawesenm'\n- Paul Rohrbaugh\n- 'Krazy KZ'\n- Koby Bland\n- Christopher Payne\n- Zach Williams\n- Michael R Sheffield\n- Rich Biggs\n- 'JTrip'\n- Brant Eaton\n- 'wvot'\n- James Pringle\n- 'AccuShoot.com'\n- 'Sopaul'\n- Lisa Overly\n- Connor Davies\n- 'Necko'\n- Gerardo Flores\n- Anthony Eufemio\n- 'Donkbot'\n- Gage Kissinger\n- 'coco Coco'\n‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê\n\nSupport us on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity\nFollow us on X: https://x.com/Police_Activity\n\nüõçÔ∏è Check out our Amazon store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/PoliceActivity üõçÔ∏è\n\nDisclosure: Please note that we will receive a small commission from purchases made through our Amazon store.
